Look! It's an Axe! No, a hatchet!

... it's RATCHET!

## Introduction
This is a TACACS+ server.

It implements PAP and ASCII.

It's written in a memory-safe language, and has very few dependencies.

## Status
This server implements a slim portion of the TACACS+ protocol.

It's very fast and lightweight, with compiler optimization enabled, on a low-end system in a basic configuration, I've seen it service as many as 75,000 requests / sec -- even single-threaded.

## Future plans
- [ ] beautiful front-end  
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Config interfaces
  - [ ] Support for shadowed passwords instead of,... that.
  - [ ] Make sure that the CSV escaping makes sense, maybe switch to TSV

### Later
- [ ] Containerized distribution
- [ ] Benchmarks / 
- [ ] Rest of the protocol / MSCHAPv2
- [ ] Support for complete set of security controls
  - [ ] ... and automated auditing
  - [ ] ... and 8907 future recs
  - [ ] ... and authenticating against unrecoverable passwords
- [ ] fail2ban-like mechanism to protect server from misbehaving clients
- [ ] Constructively walk through LLVM opt flag configurations 'rustc passes'
- [ ] CRUD config changes (currently will necessitate brief server relaunch)
- [ ] Something to meaningfully improve using GNS3 to run tests over this
  - [ ] ... or maybe setup like a dynaMIPS thing some way how

### Done
- [x] Multi-threaded implementation
  - [x] the ASCII protocol couples too tightly, yikes!
- [x] ASCII Authentication
- [x] Configuration
  - [x] Configurable user list
  - [x] Configurable clients list
  - [x] Configurable port

## Kernel Hacking / Optimization
I discovered that when using `perf` to profile `ratchet` that the pipeline was 30% faster, which was,... odd.

After some intense digging, I still don't know for sure, however I did discover that:

- `echo "50" | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/core/busy_poll`
- `echo "50" | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/core/busy_read`

(corresponding to a pretty aggressive polling cycle) yielded *approximately* the same benefit.
